# BankApp
Simple Bank Application

*IMPORTANT*
- default manager username: admin
- default manager password: admin



## Customers 
- can withdraw,deposit, and purchase online
- have a membership discount applied when purchasing online (Gold, Silver, Platinum)

## Managers:
- can add and remove customers by inputting customer usernames and password

## Bank Database:
- bank stores all information through multiples files
- one file per customer
- database file containing the names of all customers
- database file containing the names of managers


#### Future Updates:
- In order to create more managers, the client must go into file managers.txt in the C:\bankApplication_byJohnCabuguason directory and add manager_username;manager_password;manager
to a new line each time. Integrate this into the GUI to make it more efficient for new managers.
